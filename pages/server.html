<h2> <font color="blue"> What is a Server? </font> </h2>
<p align="justify">A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine might be a dedicated server or it might be used for other purposes. </p>
<br>
<p align="justify">In the client/server programming model, a server program awaits and fulfills requests from client programs, which might be running in the same, or other computers. A given application in a computer might function as a client with requests for services from other programs and as a server of requests from other programs.</p>

<h2> <font color="blue"> How servers works? </font></h2>
<p align="justify"> The term server can refer to a physical machine, a virtual machine or to software that is performing server services. The way that a server works varies considerably depending on how the word server is being used. </p>

A physical server is simply a computer that is used to run server software. The differences between a server and a desktop computer will be discussed in detail in the next section. It's a recognizable machine with motherboard, CPU, memory, and the like. Often referred to as "bare metal servers", physical servers have no gap between the physical hardware and the operating system.

<font color="blue">Virtual environment (container)</font>, a container-based environment where the underlying hardware and OS is unchanged, but the application is sandboxed into a context where it sees a controlled environment of the environment variables and a particular version of a programming language etc. It may also be used to prevent this application making persistent changes outside of this sandbox.
<br>
<br>
<font color="blue">Virtual machine</font>, a virtual emulation of a physical computer.
<br>
<br>
<font color="blue">Virtual private server</font>, a method of server hosting using virtual machines.
