 <p> <font color="blue"> <b>What is a computer? </b> </font> <br> </p>
<p> A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos. </p>
<br> 
<p> <font color="blue"> <b>Hardware vs. Software </b> </font> <br> </p>
<p>Before we talk about different types of computers, let's talk about two things all computers have in common: hardware and software. Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. <b>Examples:</b> of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.</p>
<br>
<p>Everything you do on your computer will rely on both <b>hardware and software</b>. For example, right now you may be viewing this lesson in a web browser (software) and using your mouse (hardware) to click from page to page. As you learn about different types of computers, ask yourself about the differences in their hardware. As you progress through this tutorial, you'll see that different types of computers also often use different types of software.</p>
<br>
<p>Many people use desktop computers at work, home, and school. Desktop computers are designed to be placed on a desk, and they're typically made up of a few different parts, including the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. The second type of computer you may be familiar with is a laptop computer, commonly called a laptop. Laptops are battery-powered computers that are more portable than desktops, allowing you to use them almost anywhere.</p>
